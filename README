We've moved ! 

For biojava integration, structural biology and bioinformatics, and data mining utilities, checkout 
the RudolF project, which now envelopes the source in bioclojure.  HELP WANTED ON RUDOLF from clojure and haskell folks.

https://github.com/jayunit100/RudolF


Also, Jan Aerts is working on a somewhat more structured bioclojure repository !  Check it out !

https://github.com/jandot/bioclojure 


The code in this project, although operational, is , as of October 31 2011, unmaintained !
