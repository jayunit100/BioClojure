We have no single "readme" because these projects
are currently only loosely coupled.

Please see the various "flavors" of READMEs, based on your interests, or contact
one of the developers

Important startup notes 

If you are working on the NMR section : you might need jmol.  Please read the README_NMR / README_JMOL instructions.
