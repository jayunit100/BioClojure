;; This demonstrates two important distinctions in clojure (1) Strings
;; are "Sequences" : When we send "ABCDEFGH" as an argument to a "map"
;; function, each character is individually sent to the map's function
;; (in this case, "convert").  (2) In order to find a key (which is a
;; string in this case) in the Map, the char must be converted into a
;; string (3) Clojure is dynamically, strongly typed -- source:
