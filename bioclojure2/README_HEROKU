BioClojure is now online ! 

To deploy : 

1) Checkout and set up the project, (see the README).
2) Make sure you have RubyGems installed, so you can run the $>gem install commands....
3) Create a heroku account if you don't already have one.  
4) Follow these directions 
   https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure
   (Ignore the parts regarding the Procfile and the web.clj file, since we already 
   have those in Bioclojure's source file.
5) Finally, when you run the command to "push" to the heroku repository, 
     sudo git push heroku master
     heroku ps:scale web=1
6) If you cant push to the heroku master, try to run heroku keys:add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (this adds an ssh key to heroku servers, i believe, so that
the recognize you) //


-- You can change the code locally, and run it on port 5000 by typing >foreman start, and navigating to port 5000
-- Then, you can push your changes by commiting them to git, and pushing to the heroku master.
